#Hi! I'm @Immutare  👋
=============

I'm currently a FullStack web developer based in Mexico 🇲🇽
I'm a developer who is currently trying to pivot to Python and hopefully I'll make it to be a FANG developer. 🧐

I'll try to take notes here of what I've learned and where I'm at in my training 🦾

Currently studying
=============
- 🌎 English (I have an advanced english, but still have ways to improve)
- 👨‍💻 Backend development
- 🐍 Python


Notes
=============
This is blank, for now I've just begun.
